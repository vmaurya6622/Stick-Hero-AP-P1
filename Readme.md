1. we have included two basic junit tests that will help in debugging the code also
 	we added music and other effects to make our game more pleasing

2. **BONUS** we have also added a slider to adjust difficulty level in the game in the settings menu
	where 1 is the lowest or easiest and 10 is highest and hardest.


Instructions :
1. Open Intellij Idea Ide / or any other JAVA-IDE and open the Project.
2. Add the required javafx libraries in project structure for better Results.
3. Go to src/App.java
4. Run the File App.java
5. Now enter your name and continue then click "play"
6. Game will run!
7. Click on the screen the stick will raise and release the button to lay it down the track to walk over the stick to the platform.
8. We have also added the function to walk upside down too, just click again when the character is on the stick.
9. It will move down the stick to collect cherries.
10. Note that music play can stop during the play this is due to incorrect running (Running from file other than App.java) or some issues within the usage of dependencies. Always run by compiling and packaging by Maven.
